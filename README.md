- **Automation**: _Merriam Webster_ [AUTOMATION](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/automation)

	- the state of being operated automatically
	- automatically controlled operation of an apparatus, process, or system by mechanical or electronic devices that take the place of human labor

Many networked environments are made up of several silo'd areas... or _grottos_ ... with security boundaries that make it difficult to automate tasks across those environments.  For example accessing resources via SSH across network boundaries.

Grottomation is meant to help centrally manage tasks using a _call back_ mechanism.  Each Grotto will have an agent or _fountain_ to run tasks in the local network boundary that makes calls to a central location to determine when and what to run.
